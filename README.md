# Welcome to my side project 
In an attempt to actually do this right no seriously I'm going to do this right, I have chosen a front-end framework (Vue JS) and given 
myself time to work on it. It's not the prettiest thing in the world, and I hope to continue to build on it as I learn and have 
the time to.
